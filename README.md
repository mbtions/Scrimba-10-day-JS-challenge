#### What I learnt these days -

## Update day 1 : add two numbers and more than two numbers in the parameters
Here, this challenge was completely worthy to learn as it introduced about the new concept of javascript of taking n numbers of parameters and add them
   function func_name(...array_name)  // has "...array_name" as parameter which concatenates the parameters(at function call) into an array named 'array_name'

## Update day 2 : return the longest string among the array of strings
Here, this challenge's logic was quite interesting and seems easy to write in javascript rather than other languages
first, it was find the longest string among all and then it was added to longestWords and then returned.

## Update day 3 : Replace the element of the array with the other substitution element
Here, tis challenge was very easy to code, just the function arrayReplace took the arguments for the element to be replaced and the element that substitutes it, it was a quite easy and interesting program to code in javascript.
