## Update day 1 : add two numbers and more than two numbers in the parameters
Here, this challenge was completely worthy to learn as it introduced about the new concept of javascript of taking n numbers of parameters and add them
   function func_name(...array_name)  // has "...array_name" as parameter which concatenates the parameters(at function call) into an array named 'array_name'
